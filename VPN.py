### INSTRUCTIONS ###
# The VPN, like the server, must listen for connections from the client on IP address
# VPN_IP and port VPN_port. Then, once a connection is established and a message recieved,
# the VPN must parse the message to obtain the server IP address and port, and, without
# disconnecting from the client, establish a connection with the server the same way the
# client does, send the message from the client to the server, and wait for a reply.
# Upon receiving a reply from the server, it must forward the reply along its connection
# to the client. Then the VPN is free to close both connections and exit.

# The VPN server must additionally print appropriate trace messages and send back to the
# client appropriate error messages.
